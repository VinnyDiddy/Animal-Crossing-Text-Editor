# Vinny's Tips!
__At least, from the little I've learned.__

I very much only know the bare minimum when it comes to using this thing,
so please bare that in mind when reading this, I'm not a smart coder or
anything. But here's the phrases I've been using when it comes to making
little edits to the dialogue.

	<Pause [amount]>
  This is simply the pauses inbetween words, I think it goes off of the amount frames, but I don't know...
  I typically use around 6-12 when pausing inbetween words.

 
	<Press A>
  Wherever you put this, the player will have to Press A to continue the dialogue.


	<Clear Text>
  Clears the text in currently shown, typically done after an <Press A> is used


	<End Conversation>
  Ends the current conversation.


	<Expression [Expression Name]>
  The Text Editor has a way of knowing whether the emotion you put in is right or wrong,
  and sometimes the editor changes the emotion to UNKNOWN 0x0000x when you save on that
  set of text, it should default to a emotion.
